# Azure Stream Analytics Manager Overview

This service allows the management of Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) jobs,
including setting the configuration and starting, stopping, and 
monitoring their statuses.

The ASA job is supported by two 
[reference data](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-use-reference-data)
sets: one that defines rules and one that defines device groups.
Rules are stored in json format and device groups are stored in csv format.

The rules reference data is generated by the information managed by 
the [Telemetry Microservice][telemetry-microservice-url].

This microservice transforms telemetry rules into stream
processing logic.

The device groups reference data is used to
identify which group of rules to apply to an
incoming telemetry message.
The device groups are managed by the
[Configuration Microservice][configuration-microservice-url]
and use Azure IoT Hub device twin queries.

## Why?

This microservice was built as part of the 
[Azure IoT Remote Monitoring](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet) 
project to provide a generic implementation for an end-to-end IoT solution. 
More information [here][rm-arch-url].

## Features

* Manage ASA jobs
* Export rules defined in the
  [Telemetry Microservice][telemetry-microservice-url] to ASA
* Export device groups defined in the
  [Configuration Microservice][configuration-microservice-url] for ASA consumption

# How to use

## Running the service with Docker

You can run the microservice and its dependencies using
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with the instructions
[here][run-with-docker-url].

## Running the service locally

   ex. "core.windows.net" }
* `PCS_EVENTHUB_CONNSTRING` = { Event Hub Connection String for RootManageSharedAccessKey }
* `PCS_EVENTHUB_NAME` = { Name of Event Hub }

## Running the service with Visual Studio
1. Make sure the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are set up.
1. Install any edition of [Visual Studio 2017][vs-install-url] or Visual
   Studio for Mac. When installing check ".NET Core" workload. If you
   already have Visual Studio installed, then ensure you have
   [.NET Core Tools for Visual Studio 2017][dotnetcore-tools-url]
   installed (Windows only).
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio
1. Edit the WebService project properties by right clicking on the Webservice project > Properties > Debug. 
  Add required [environment variables](#3.-environment-variables-required-to-run-the-service) 
  to the Debug settings. In Windows you can also set these [in your system][windows-envvars-howto-url].
1. In Visual Studio, start the WebService project
1. Using an HTTP client like [Postman][postman-url],
   use the RESTful API to test out the service.

## Running the service from the command line

1. Make sure the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are set up.
1. Set the required [environment variables](#3.-environment-variables-required-to-run-the-service)
in your system. More information on environment variables [here](#configuration-and-environment-variables).
1. Use the scripts in the [scripts](scripts) folder for many frequent tasks:
   * `build`: compile all the projects and run the tests.
   * `compile`: compile all the projects.
   * `run`: compile the projects and run the service. This will prompt for
      elevated privileges in Windows to run the web service.

## Project Structure

This microservice contains the following projects:
* **WebService.csproj** - C# web service exposing REST interface for ASA management
  functionality
* **WebService.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for web services functionality
* **Services.csproj** - C# assembly containining business logic for interacting 
  with Azure services.
* **Services.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for services functionality
* **DeviceGroupsAgent.csproj** - C# assembly containing business logic
  for querying device group to device id mapping and writing that mapping
  to Azure Blob Storage
* **DeviceGroupsAgent.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for device groups agent functionality
* **TelemetryRulesAgent.csproj** - C# assembly containing business logic
  for checking whether telemetry rules have changed, and exporting rules to ASA
  when they change
* **TelemetryRulesAgent.Test.csproj** - Unit tests for telemetry rules agent functionality
* **Solution/scripts** - Contains build scripts, docker container creation scripts, 
  and scripts for running the microservice from the command line.
* **Solution/scripts/asa** - Contains ASA query, UDF functions, device group, rules samples
  and shell script to convert query and UDF functions into an ARM parameter object.

## Updating the Docker image

The `scripts` folder includes a [docker](scripts/docker) subfolder with the files
required to package the service into a Docker image:

* `Dockerfile`: docker images specifications
* `build`: build a Docker container and store the image in the local registry
* `run`: run the Docker container from the image stored in the local registry
* `content`: a folder with files copied into the image, including the entry point script

## Configuration and Environment variables

The service configuration is stored using ASP.NET Core configuration
adapters, in [appsettings.ini](WebService/appsettings.ini). The INI format
allows to store values in a readable format, with comments. The application
also supports references to environment variables, which is used to import
credentials and networking details.

The configuration files in the repository reference some environment
variables that need to be created at least once. Depending on your OS and
the IDE, there are several ways to manage environment variables:

* Windows: the variables can be set [in the system][windows-envvars-howto-url]
  as a one time only task. The
  [env-vars-setup.cmd](scripts/env-vars-setup.cmd) script included needs to
  be prepared and executed just once. The settings will persist across
  terminal sessions and reboots.
* Visual Studio: the variables can be set in the projects's settings, under
  Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Environment
* For Linux and MacOS environments, the [env-vars-setup](scripts/env-vars-setup)
  script needs to be executed every time a new console is opened.
  Depending on the OS and terminal, there are ways to persist values
  globally, for more information these pages should help:

# Troubleshooting

It is possible Azure Stream Analytics may crash. If this happens (rules stop evaluating), 
restart ASA in the portal with the following steps:
1. Navigate to your ASA instance on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
  If you deployed an entire Remote Monitoring solution, your instance will be in
  a resource group with the name of your solution.
1. On the Overview ASA portal page, click "Stop" on the top of the page, 
  then click "Yes" if prompted to confirm.
1. Wait for the job to stop. This may take a few minutes.
1. Once the job is stopped, click "Start"
   1. This will cause a flyout to appear to select your job output start time.
      If you do not need the job to run on previous data, click "Now", if
      you want to re-evaluate data that may have been missed, set the start time to
      the time of the crash.
